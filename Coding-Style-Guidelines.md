## tl;dr;

* follow the style around you unless you think it is super crazy, in which case check here or ask
* leave code better than you found it

## Ruby

see https://github.com/styleguide/ruby with the following exceptions:

* we're not strict about using TomDoc, although it's a nice format. (their Documentation section)
* we don't care about double quotes vs single quotes for regular strings (second bullet point in their "Strings" section)
* we don't care about hash rocket syntax vs JSON style syntax for hashes (their Hashes section)
